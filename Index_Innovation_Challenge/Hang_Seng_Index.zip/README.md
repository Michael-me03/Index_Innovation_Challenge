#   Index_Innovation_Challenge
## This project aims to calculate a financial index for stocks listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The index is computed by evaluating key financial metrics, such as free float percentage, financial reports, and other relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for each company. The goal is to  provide a standardized financial index that can be used to compare different stocks based on how they can represent the Local Stockmarket in Hong Kong and China.
